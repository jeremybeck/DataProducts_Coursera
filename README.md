# DataProducts_Coursera
This is the my repo for projects in the Johns Hopkins 'Developing Data Products' course.

The three scripts here comprise a Shiny App.

This app is the minimum viable product for an exploratory data analysis app to explore how 
related predictors are to a target variable. 

The app incorporates rCharts plotting.

Really, this was more about learning how to use Shiny and incorporate rCharts than anything else.
